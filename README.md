# GuessTheButtonOutOfNButtons
### WellCode - My second project
Enter a number (N) from 2 to 100. After submitting the number, N buttons (playing cards) will be generated. One of them (chosen at random) is the winner. Press a button and find out if you guessed the winning button or not.
#### I have to mention that the confetti were not created by me. This is the source: https://www.codehim.com/animation-effects/javascript-confetti-explosion-effect/
